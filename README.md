# Udemy
ðŸŽ“ Udemy Clone (HTML &amp; CSS)  A frontend-only Udemy clone built using HTML5 and CSS3 for learning purposes. Features include a responsive layout, course grid, navigation bar, and footer. This project helped me practice responsive design and modern layout techniques with Flexbox and Grid.  ðŸš« No backend â€“ purely a static educational project.
